# Simple DevOps

This repo is a starting point to find an answer on the question how to profit from all the 'DevOps goodies' without spending too much resources on it.

The first goal is to improve the question, collect resources, do some experiments and make an analysis. Hopefully this will result in a blog post or paper. Perhaps some proof of concepts too.

After that we can see if we can make something workable for internal usage, setup a cluster, tie some services together, etc. In the long run, this might even be the basis for setting up some kind of service offering for freelance developers and small agencies.
